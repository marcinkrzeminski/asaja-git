# Privacy Policy for Asana Git Branch Generator

**Last Updated:** January 8, 2026

## Overview

Asana Git Branch Generator ("the Extension") is a browser extension that helps users generate Git branch names from Asana tasks. This privacy policy explains our data practices.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any user data.**

The Extension:
- Does not collect any personal information
- Does not track user behavior
- Does not use cookies or analytics
- Does not communicate with external servers
- Does not store any data outside your browser

## How the Extension Works

The Extension operates entirely within your browser:
1. It reads the task title and ID from Asana pages you visit
2. It generates a formatted Git branch name locally in your browser
3. It allows you to copy the generated branch name to your clipboard
4. All processing happens locally on your device

## Permissions

The Extension requests the following permissions:
- **activeTab**: Required to read task information from Asana pages and inject the branch generator button into the Asana interface
- **Access to app.asana.com**: Required to function only on Asana pages

These permissions are used solely to provide the core functionality of generating Git branch names. No data is transmitted outside your browser.

## Third-Party Services
